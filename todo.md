- [x] Add print statement
- [x] Add printing of strings
- [x] Add ability for variables to also be strings
- [x] Clean up both implementations of parser and put them into one
- [x] Implement equality (==)
- [x] Add array
- [x] Add dictionary
- [x] Add ability to index array and dictionary
- [x] Add if and else
- [x] add bool operators (true, false)
- [x] add comparators (< and >)
- [x] Add or, and keywords
- [x] Add while loop
- [x] Add break keyword
- [x] Add functions


At this stage the language should have enough native support to be used such that other functions can be written in Alethia
- [x] Implement function to get length of an array
- [ ] Implement ability to add strings together (string manipulation should all be possible with for loops and string indexing)
- [ ] Implemnent modulo and exponent
- [ ] Add ability to index strings
- [ ] Implement for loop

Extra steps to improve the language:
- [ ] Add ability to read and write files
- [ ] Add floats (yes this is not in the language at the moment...)
- [ ] Add comments (actually shouldn't be too difficult. Just ignore them and don't add anything to the lexer)
- [ ] Add not keyword
